# F9T Log Gauges

A simple, nearly bare-bones, web-only application that let's you upload a log file produced by an F9T ODB+ DME and view playback via dynamic gauges.

## Setup

If you want to run this locally, all you need to do is spin up a local server. If you're running a windows machine, I've included `run_server.bat` at the root of this project you can utilize - simply run it and it should spin up a local python server (assuming you have python installed).

If you want to use the hosted service through github, just click [here](https://drewtadams.github.io/f9t_log_gauges/).

## Getting Started

1. Click "Choose File" and select your log file (MUST be a .csv file).
2. Control the playback with the following controls:
    * `Beginning`: sends playback to the beginning
    * `Start/Pause`: toggles playback
    * `End`: sends playback to the end
    * timeline slider: slide left or right to view specific moments in the playback
